#1) 	What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)?
development

#2) User brute-forcing to find the username & password:

There were 2 text files in this directory, both were notes sent by a "K" and a "J". I tried bruteforcing using Metasploits ssh_login module with username "J" and "K" to no avail, not to mention, extremely time inefficient as the program was not threaded. Lets use better threaded software, namely Hydra! Unfortunately even Hydra on the wordlists I was feeding it was going to take 20+ hours to complete....we need a better way!
